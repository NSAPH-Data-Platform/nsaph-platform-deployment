# NSAPH Data Platform Deployment Package
                                 
Deployment of NSAPH Data Platform is based on  
CWL-Airflow Docker Deployment developed
by Harvard FAS RC in collaboration with Forome Association.

Essentially, this is a fork of: 
[Apache Airflow + CWL in Docker with Optional Conda and R](https://github.com/ForomePlatform/airflow-cwl-docker)
                                                            
It follows 
[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) 
approach.
